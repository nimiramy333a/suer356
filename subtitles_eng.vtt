WEBVTT

00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:10.208
Rain.

00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:13.666
I've never liked rain.

00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:41.250
I know people say

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.666
that rain is a blessing.

00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:47.958
But for me…

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:50.833
Dad!

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:54.958
rain

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.875
always brings disaster.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.208
Time waits for no one.

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:39.166
Akid,

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:43.583
you said

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.625
today you'd be ready to share.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.458
Kabir.

00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:10.416
Do you believe that in this world,

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:13.500
some people can go back

00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:17.208
in time?

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.000
Like time travel?

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:31.416
Yes, Akid.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.791
Like time travel.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:36.541
Hold on, what's your point, Dad?

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:43.541
You have to listen to me carefully.

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:46.708
In our family

00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:50.791
once a person reaches 18, like you have,

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:55.208
we can go back in time.

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:06.875
But only to go back to the past.

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.083
Okay.

00:04:08.708 --> 00:04:13.333
Can you explain clearly?

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:18.791
Why don't you think of

00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:20.958
numbers.

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:23.125
Any combination of numbers.

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:24.791
It can be as complicated as you want.

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.458
Write them in your book.

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:47.250
And then?

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.250
Your wife calls

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.125
to remind you to buy bread and eggs.

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:04.041
Hold on.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.000
Okay,

00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:12.291
I will buy them.

00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:20.416
-But how…?
-Your assistant will enter

00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:24.250
to inquire about
the appointment with patient 29.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.958
Come in.

00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:32.166
Sorry to bother you, Doctor.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.500
Appointment for patient 29 today.

00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:35.583
Is that still on?

00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:45.833
Let's push it to tomorrow.

00:05:54.916 --> 00:05:56.250
How did you…?

00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:58.208
And the number

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.375
is 11911911.

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:05.333
Correct?

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.541
So you have…

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:22.125
I've gone back to a few minutes ago.

00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:25.625
I knew your wife would call.

00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:27.458
Your assistant would enter

00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:31.125
and when I was back, I asked you myself

00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.291
about the numbers.

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:43.541
Now let me ask you.

00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:47.291
How?

00:06:58.708 --> 00:07:00.708
So you're ready to hear my story.

00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:05.166
Dad.

00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:08.000
Dad.

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:11.833
Dad.

00:07:13.375 --> 00:07:15.000
What's wrong with you?

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:25.416
You've gone back.

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:30.333
I don't know why we have this ability.

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:32.541
Your grandfather told me

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:35.916
for a long time now

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.500
we've been able to do this.

00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:41.416
Dad.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.916
That means, with this ability

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.458
-we can…
-Can be rich?

00:07:45.208 --> 00:07:46.875
You can dream.

00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.791
I've tried it. The money never sticks.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.333
Akid, listen here.

00:07:53.833 --> 00:07:56.125
There are a few rules

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.666
that your great-grandfather followed,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.250
your grandfather followed,

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:00.833
and I followed.

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.583
The first rule.

00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:10.125
When you go back in time to be rich

00:08:11.666 --> 00:08:13.583
it doesn't work.

00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:14.791
Is that true, Dad?

00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:18.708
I dabbled in stocks previously.

00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:22.000
Got a few hundred thousand in my account.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.166
I tasted it.

00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:27.208
But when your grandfather got sick,

00:08:30.708 --> 00:08:32.416
it drained all the money I had.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.666
It kept happening. Twice, thrice.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.541
The money, Akid, however you keep it

00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:40.916
won't stick.

00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:43.500
The second rule.

00:08:50.833 --> 00:08:52.125
Akid, look at this flower.

00:08:55.041 --> 00:08:57.166
This flower is destined to wither.

00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:01.250
Whatever you do, it will still wither.

00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:07.833
Sometimes, Akid,

00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:10.333
you have to accept

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:12.125
things that are destined to happen.

00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:17.541
Understand?

00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:52.166
Look at that grin.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.250
Akid.

00:09:53.916 --> 00:09:55.458
Akid, wake up.

00:09:58.333 --> 00:09:59.791
Dreaming of your girlfriend?

00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:00.833
What, Mom?

00:10:00.916 --> 00:10:01.833
Gosh…

00:10:01.916 --> 00:10:05.125
Do you remember we said we’d go out today?

00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:07.083
Okay, hold on. I'll get ready.

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:20.583
Feels like an Eid morning.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.416
This kid has just spoiled the moment.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.166
Mom, you're not ready.
You said you'd come shopping with us.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.250
No, Mom is not coming along.

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.416
You woke up too late.

00:10:35.416 --> 00:10:37.250
We're not going shopping after all.

00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:39.458
Come with me to buy fertilizer.

00:10:40.458 --> 00:10:41.875
Look at the youngsters nowadays.

00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.333
They wake up late

00:10:43.416 --> 00:10:44.625
and act all nonchalant.

00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:47.000
No guilt at all. Let's go.

00:10:48.583 --> 00:10:50.416
-I take my leave, Mom.
-Okay.

00:11:03.083 --> 00:11:04.291
How much, Wong?

00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:06.375
One hundred and ten. But for you,

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.208
-just make it 100.
-No.

00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:10.083
I inconvenienced you, take this 120.

00:11:10.166 --> 00:11:11.666
Okay, thank you, sir.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.333
You look happy.

00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:19.291
Okay, it's settled.

00:11:19.916 --> 00:11:22.000
Other shops have fertilizer too, Dad.

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:24.125
Why wait till night
to buy gardening items?

00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:26.291
You won't understand.
Only Wong's fertilizer will work

00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:28.708
on my flowers, you know that?

00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:30.916
What are you waiting for? That one.

00:11:44.208 --> 00:11:45.041
Let go of this bag!

00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:46.875
-I said, let it go!
-Help!

00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.500
-Or else!
-Help!

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.208
Hey!

00:11:53.541 --> 00:11:54.625
Dad!

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.500
Are you okay?

00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:24.833
Dad.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:31.208
Dad!

00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:42.916
Akid!

00:13:35.125 --> 00:13:37.208
The third rule,

00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:38.750
and it's the most important,

00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:41.541
you can only go back in time

00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:45.500
when you are in a calm state.

00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:18.750
The person who stabbed him

00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:20.708
was arrested yesterday.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.250
Who is he, Mom? Where is he now?

00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:32.750
He's an addict, Akid.

00:14:34.125 --> 00:14:35.333
Don't waste your time.

00:14:37.833 --> 00:14:41.416
And the car, that was an accident, Akid.

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:45.875
We have to accept

00:14:46.791 --> 00:14:48.708
that his time has come.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.708
This is fate, Akid.

00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.625
We have to accept it.

00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:12.541
You have to be strong.

00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:17.166
Promise me.

00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:20.750
You'll be strong.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.458
You have to be really strong.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.750
Since that day,

00:15:41.458 --> 00:15:42.750
I promised…

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Sir.

00:15:46.916 --> 00:15:49.041
to be stronger.

00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:50.333
POLICE
INSPECTOR AKID AZIZ

00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:58.541
Sir, over here.

00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:01.958
ELECTRIC MAINS

00:16:03.875 --> 00:16:04.916
Man.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.333
Akid.

00:16:06.416 --> 00:16:07.916
Her name is Aisyah, age 41.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.416
Her daughter, Min, is in year six.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.458
She's been in rehab for drug abuse.

00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:13.583
She has stayed in this flat
for about a year.

00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:16.125
The whole place knows
that she's a drug addict.

00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:22.333
You don't have to study it so much.

00:16:22.416 --> 00:16:23.708
Why not?

00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:26.250
Isn't this open and shut for you?

00:16:26.333 --> 00:16:27.875
Your record is perfect.

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:35.708
I've never told anyone of this ability

00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:38.666
because I don't know

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.125
what they would do

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:42.541
if they had this ability.

00:16:42.625 --> 00:16:44.708
So I chose to keep it a secret.

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:03.750
Don't get close.

00:17:03.833 --> 00:17:05.083
What do you want?

00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:06.666
What do you want?

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:07.750
Calm down.

00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:10.083
Calm down, Aisyah.

00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:12.583
Aisyah, calm down.

00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:14.708
What do you want?

00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:15.666
Aisyah, calm down.

00:17:16.875 --> 00:17:18.166
That's Min, right?

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.583
Aisyah.

00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:20.833
Think about Min.

00:17:20.916 --> 00:17:21.791
Poor Min.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.041
Poor Min?

00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:25.125
All this while.

00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:28.125
Has anyone cared about me? About Min?

00:17:28.208 --> 00:17:30.916
No one here cares about me.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.416
No one cares about Min.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.375
Aisyah.

00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:36.250
If you jump, what would that solve?

00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:39.750
What would that solve?

00:17:39.833 --> 00:17:41.875
If I jump.

00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:47.083
I will prove that I'm a good mom.

00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:09.333
Min.

00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:13.041
I love you.

00:19:22.875 --> 00:19:26.916
I don't go back immediately when I fail.

00:19:29.166 --> 00:19:32.125
I try to appreciate my failure,

00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:39.083
and think about if I should change

00:19:39.166 --> 00:19:41.916
what is fated to be.

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:24.500
Why didn't you go back?

00:20:24.583 --> 00:20:26.958
Why didn't you go back to save me?

00:20:27.041 --> 00:20:28.791
You don't love me.

00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:31.291
I tried, I couldn't.

00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:33.291
You're soft.

00:20:56.708 --> 00:20:58.041
All this time.

00:20:58.125 --> 00:21:00.750
Have you cared about me? About Min?

00:21:00.833 --> 00:21:03.500
No one here cares about me.

00:21:03.583 --> 00:21:04.958
No one cares about Min.

00:21:05.041 --> 00:21:06.166
Aisyah.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.250
Listen to what I'm about to tell you.

00:21:09.708 --> 00:21:10.791
I know.

00:21:11.833 --> 00:21:14.083
People belittle you.

00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:15.250
Belittle Min.

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.416
Because they don't understand you.

00:21:18.916 --> 00:21:21.791
They don't feel your experiences.

00:21:23.666 --> 00:21:24.916
But,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.291
have you ever asked Min

00:21:28.083 --> 00:21:30.458
if she wants all of this?

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.541
Min.

00:21:41.083 --> 00:21:43.041
Do you want all this?

00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:48.166
If you die today

00:21:48.791 --> 00:21:51.708
will all your problems go away?

00:21:57.625 --> 00:21:58.583
Mom.

00:22:00.333 --> 00:22:02.750
I want to live.

00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:04.916
I want to live, I don't want to die.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.750
Mom, I want to live.

00:22:09.666 --> 00:22:13.583
I want to live, Mom. I don't want to die.

00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:05.458
This is my system.

00:23:06.416 --> 00:23:10.458
The first number is the amount
of attempts I've made to go back.

00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:11.750
The second number

00:23:11.833 --> 00:23:13.916
is how long I want to go back.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.125
ADRIANA'S OFFICE

00:23:15.208 --> 00:23:16.500
When I tick it

00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:19.875
that means my purpose
for going back has been successful.

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:22.458
But what is it for?

00:23:23.916 --> 00:23:25.458
Everytime I go back,

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.000
I will be much older than before.

00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:35.333
Everytime I go back,

00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:38.791
I have to sacrifice

00:23:39.625 --> 00:23:41.291
my time in this world.

00:23:43.583 --> 00:23:44.583
For example?

00:23:50.041 --> 00:23:51.916
If I go back for a year

00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:57.666
I will die a year earlier
than my actual death date.

00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:01.333
That means

00:24:01.416 --> 00:24:03.875
I would've sacrificed a year

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.833
of my life.

00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:10.375
But how would you know?

00:24:10.458 --> 00:24:12.625
I can feel it, Kabir.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.500
My energy is not like before.

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:21.208
My body gets older

00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:23.208
every time I go back.

00:24:25.125 --> 00:24:27.083
I began to realize that

00:24:27.791 --> 00:24:31.541
nothing is crueler than time.

00:24:33.583 --> 00:24:36.000
For time knows no patience.

00:24:37.583 --> 00:24:41.291
It will leave you in a flash.

00:24:41.375 --> 00:24:43.416
Because that's the nature of time.

00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:46.833
It will take everything.

00:24:46.916 --> 00:24:48.500
Regardless of when

00:24:48.583 --> 00:24:49.750
and why.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.666
Man.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.458
You said we were going to dinner.

00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:55.250
Why are we going to a party?

00:24:56.166 --> 00:24:58.791
My friend invited us to this party.

00:24:58.875 --> 00:25:01.291
There's a barbecue.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.541
-Let's not.
-Why?

00:25:05.291 --> 00:25:06.916
Look at you.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.250
You don't want to socialize,

00:25:08.333 --> 00:25:09.875
don't want to chat to people.

00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:11.333
If you just stay at home, what do you get?

00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:13.041
Just cooped up.

00:25:13.125 --> 00:25:14.041
Let's go.

00:25:21.333 --> 00:25:23.666
There's mutton.

00:25:26.083 --> 00:25:27.541
Dude!

00:25:28.875 --> 00:25:31.208
There he goes, casually cutting the queue.

00:25:33.416 --> 00:25:36.541
You just cut the queue,
didn't even look back.

00:25:36.625 --> 00:25:39.375
Don't worry, there's plenty
of mutton here.

00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:43.375
Listen to your friend.

00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:46.041
Misha.

00:25:46.125 --> 00:25:47.791
Akid, this is my friend, Misha.

00:25:48.791 --> 00:25:50.375
She's the one who invited us here.

00:25:50.458 --> 00:25:52.166
When did I invite you?

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.625
You were the one who begged to come.

00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:56.666
Even if that's true

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:57.958
don't say it in front of the mutton.

00:25:58.041 --> 00:25:59.166
It's hurtful.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.333
Quickly.

00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:03.250
-Hurry up! I'm hungry.
-Hold on.

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:05.625
I want the gizzard.

00:26:07.083 --> 00:26:08.833
But like I said,

00:26:08.916 --> 00:26:11.041
the nature of time is to take.

00:26:11.916 --> 00:26:13.333
But time also gives.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.041
For no reason,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.500
time gave me Sarah.

00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:26.416
-Hold on, I'm looking for the wing.
-It's this one.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.500
-Hi!
-Sarah.

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:31.791
Why didn't you pick me up? See, I'm late.

00:26:31.875 --> 00:26:34.791
Sorry, I had to be here early.

00:26:34.875 --> 00:26:36.000
The mutton is here.

00:26:36.083 --> 00:26:37.041
What are you looking at?

00:26:37.125 --> 00:26:38.250
Sorry.

00:26:39.375 --> 00:26:42.000
-You stare at girls and daydream.
-I'm not.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.500
Sarah.

00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:47.041
Luq-man.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.375
Akid.

00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:54.791
Sarah.

00:26:54.875 --> 00:26:57.500
Luqman, let's have a burger inside.

00:26:57.583 --> 00:26:59.250
-There are burgers inside?
-Yes.

00:26:59.333 --> 00:27:01.458
-Let's move.
-Let's go.

00:27:07.333 --> 00:27:08.500
Told me what many times?

00:27:17.041 --> 00:27:18.333
So focused.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.166
No.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.583
Just watching them about to fight.

00:27:29.375 --> 00:27:32.375
You don't seem to be into parties.

00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:37.041
No, I'm just always busy.

00:27:37.666 --> 00:27:39.750
No time for parties.

00:27:40.875 --> 00:27:44.250
Especially when you get this kind of view.

00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:53.750
You're so funny.

00:27:54.416 --> 00:27:56.166
-Really?
-Yes.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:00.708
Okay, that means I should change
my career to be a stand-up comedian.

00:28:01.916 --> 00:28:03.500
What do you do now?

00:28:14.708 --> 00:28:16.125
Okay, I will be going now.

00:28:16.208 --> 00:28:17.916
Wait, why?

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.500
Nothing.

00:28:38.208 --> 00:28:40.583
Do I give off crook vibes?

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:48.625
-You got me.
-I'm just kidding.

00:28:53.083 --> 00:28:54.916
No wonder I couldn't find you,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.958
you're here.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.041
Do you know that you're
currently socializing with a hero.

00:29:03.125 --> 00:29:04.541
There's no need, Man.

00:29:04.625 --> 00:29:05.708
Hero?

00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:06.708
Yes.

00:29:06.791 --> 00:29:09.708
Do you know this guy
just saved a woman from

00:29:09.791 --> 00:29:11.125
jumping off a building with her daughter.

00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:14.875
Saved?

00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:28.000
What's up?

00:29:29.416 --> 00:29:31.083
I have work tomorrow. Let's go home.

00:29:31.166 --> 00:29:34.041
Sarah, in a while?

00:29:34.125 --> 00:29:36.000
It's still early. I want to hang out here.

00:29:36.083 --> 00:29:38.166
You promised to take me home. Let's go.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.583
In a while, Sarah.

00:29:39.666 --> 00:29:41.458
In a while. Misha wants to hang with me.

00:29:41.541 --> 00:29:43.375
Akid doesn’t want to stay.

00:29:43.458 --> 00:29:44.791
He can take you home.

00:29:44.875 --> 00:29:47.916
Right, Akid? You can take her back, right?

00:30:02.375 --> 00:30:04.000
Sorry, my car…

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.208
is a bit messy.

00:30:22.416 --> 00:30:23.916
If…

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.916
you could go back in time.

00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:36.250
Go back in time? What?

00:30:36.333 --> 00:30:39.000
No, I was just thinking.

00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:43.750
If you could go back in time,

00:30:44.583 --> 00:30:47.250
are there many things you'd want to fix?

00:30:52.333 --> 00:30:53.833
I don't know.

00:30:53.916 --> 00:30:55.125
Not sure.

00:30:57.083 --> 00:30:58.291
What about you?

00:31:02.208 --> 00:31:05.125
Maybe one or two things.

00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:08.000
But I appreciate my mistakes.

00:31:09.833 --> 00:31:13.791
The mistakes I made in the past

00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:17.375
shaped me to be who I am now.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.541
But don't tell me you don’t have

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.541
things you really regret doing.

00:31:28.291 --> 00:31:29.625
It's like this.

00:31:31.541 --> 00:31:36.125
I don't want to be afraid of the future,

00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:40.416
and I don't regret my past.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.083
I want to live for the moment.

00:31:52.625 --> 00:31:53.750
Tomorrow

00:31:53.833 --> 00:31:56.333
I have an Aikido demonstration.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.041
Aikido?

00:32:04.833 --> 00:32:08.250
If you're free, come.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.333
Everyone will agree that

00:33:02.041 --> 00:33:03.416
usually these feelings

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:07.791
can't be explained with logic and reason.

00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:12.208
Because I feel like
my body moved on it's own

00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:14.291
to come here.

00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:18.208
Good morning, ladies
and gentlemen. Welcome.

00:33:18.291 --> 00:33:19.708
Today, we'll start the program

00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:21.208
with a martial arts demonstration

00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:23.791
that will be performed
by Sensei Sarah Zulkifli.

00:35:16.791 --> 00:35:17.791
No problem.

00:35:18.666 --> 00:35:21.125
You fought amazingly.

00:35:21.208 --> 00:35:22.375
You don't want to become a police officer?

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.208
-You don't?
-No.

00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:29.083
But I saw you spinning them around,

00:35:29.166 --> 00:35:30.458
dropping them all over the place.

00:35:30.541 --> 00:35:32.250
When you first started learning,
it must've be the same.

00:35:32.333 --> 00:35:33.416
To fall so many times.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.750
Did it hurt?

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:36.958
It did hurt a little bit.

00:35:37.041 --> 00:35:40.916
But if we don't feel the pain,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.166
how will we get stronger, right?

00:35:50.208 --> 00:35:52.208
Do you like MMA?

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.208
Looking sharp to meet your girlfriend?

00:37:12.291 --> 00:37:14.416
Why haven't you eaten?

00:37:15.125 --> 00:37:17.916
I have something to talk to you about.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.875
What is it?

00:37:19.958 --> 00:37:21.416
Why don't you eat first?

00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:26.041
Actually.

00:37:28.958 --> 00:37:30.291
Actually,

00:37:30.375 --> 00:37:32.291
I met someone.

00:37:33.458 --> 00:37:34.416
Her name is Sarah.

00:37:39.958 --> 00:37:42.083
I've known her for two years.

00:37:42.875 --> 00:37:45.833
She teaches Japanese martial arts, Aikido.

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.375
She's special, Mom.

00:37:53.833 --> 00:37:56.291
Are you really serious about this?

00:38:01.458 --> 00:38:04.500
Things like this
shouldn't be taken lightly.

00:38:10.708 --> 00:38:12.500
After Dad died,

00:38:12.583 --> 00:38:13.916
I don't know why,

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.208
it's so hard for me
to get rid of my sadness.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.208
I know I have to be strong.

00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:27.000
Strong for myself, strong for you.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.541
But,

00:38:30.583 --> 00:38:32.375
meeting Sarah

00:38:34.541 --> 00:38:38.875
has made me appreciate life even more.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.625
Sarah has become the purpose of my life.

00:38:51.791 --> 00:38:53.291
To the point

00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:56.500
where I can forget everything

00:38:58.166 --> 00:38:59.708
that I struggled to forget.

00:39:05.541 --> 00:39:08.541
That's why I feel I am ready, Mom.

00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:13.000
I'm ready to marry Sarah.

00:39:49.416 --> 00:39:51.625
-What did she give you?
-Nothing.

00:39:51.708 --> 00:39:53.291
What did you want to say?

00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:03.625
Interested?

00:40:17.916 --> 00:40:19.041
Too early?

00:40:20.791 --> 00:40:23.791
I thought two years of knowing each other

00:40:23.875 --> 00:40:25.125
was enough.

00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:28.416
No.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.833
It's enough.

00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:36.416
I need a little time.

00:40:43.458 --> 00:40:45.916
Yeah, things like this can't be rushed.

00:40:47.291 --> 00:40:49.333
You have to think carefully.

00:40:49.416 --> 00:40:51.375
It's okay, take your time.

00:41:15.458 --> 00:41:16.708
Akid.

00:41:19.083 --> 00:41:19.958
Sarah.

00:41:20.041 --> 00:41:21.416
It's raining.

00:41:30.833 --> 00:41:32.458
Yes, except what?

00:41:39.541 --> 00:41:41.833
I will marry you.

00:41:43.583 --> 00:41:46.083
So dramatic, in the rain.

00:41:47.333 --> 00:41:49.500
Water dripping in my eyes.

00:41:52.708 --> 00:41:56.083
Since you've accepted,

00:41:56.833 --> 00:41:58.791
I have something to tell you.

00:42:04.208 --> 00:42:07.583
How do you know what's in my handbag?

00:42:08.083 --> 00:42:10.666
How do you know
the number I'm thinking of?

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.708
Sarah. Sarah, it hurts.

00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:15.000
My shoulders are going to pop, Sarah.

00:42:16.416 --> 00:42:20.333
Explain to me
how do you suddenly have magic powers.

00:42:20.416 --> 00:42:21.583
What magic?

00:42:22.125 --> 00:42:24.541
I can time travel.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.166
Okay, I'll admit that initially

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.375
I didn't want to tell you at all,

00:42:42.458 --> 00:42:45.625
and let this be my secret forever.

00:42:52.333 --> 00:42:53.666
But you're different, Sarah.

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.750
When you accepted,

00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:02.916
that's when I thought
you should know everything about me.

00:43:10.916 --> 00:43:12.833
You can go back in time.

00:43:15.541 --> 00:43:19.000
You can fix anything you want, right?

00:43:23.958 --> 00:43:25.333
So have you ever

00:43:26.083 --> 00:43:27.625
gone back in time

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:32.375
to make sure
you say the right thing to me.

00:43:33.166 --> 00:43:35.666
To make sure you say
things that I want to hear. Have you?

00:43:43.708 --> 00:43:46.000
Remember that time in the car?

00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:49.666
You said something to me.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:50.958
You said

00:43:51.041 --> 00:43:53.666
you don't want to be afraid of the future.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.625
You don't want to regret the past.

00:43:57.041 --> 00:43:59.375
You want to live for the moment.

00:44:06.041 --> 00:44:07.541
I want to live for the moment.

00:44:14.625 --> 00:44:17.625
It can't be that easy to time travel.

00:44:17.708 --> 00:44:19.500
Are there no consequences?

00:44:22.208 --> 00:44:23.208
Yes.

00:44:24.708 --> 00:44:25.791
There are.

00:44:25.875 --> 00:44:27.458
If…

00:44:27.541 --> 00:44:30.833
I do it a lot, I will get older faster.

00:44:32.833 --> 00:44:34.125
Old, like how?

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:36.666
White hairs.

00:44:46.916 --> 00:44:48.458
You promise me.

00:44:48.541 --> 00:44:50.958
You won't use this ability anymore.

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.916
Because I want to die before you.

00:45:08.625 --> 00:45:14.541
Because I don't need
for you to have superpowers

00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:16.250
or magic powers.

00:45:17.583 --> 00:45:20.166
I don't want to live
if you're not around, Akid.

00:45:26.208 --> 00:45:27.958
Okay, I promise.

00:45:33.166 --> 00:45:35.000
Peace be upon you.

00:45:35.625 --> 00:45:38.083
-Mom.
-Peace be upon you.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.541
Are you okay in the kitchen?

00:45:44.625 --> 00:45:46.041
Do you need help?

00:45:48.166 --> 00:45:50.875
He's afraid I will talk badly about him.

00:45:54.416 --> 00:45:55.833
You've accepted, right?

00:45:55.916 --> 00:45:58.250
You're serious about Akid?

00:46:04.958 --> 00:46:06.333
Yes, Aunty.

00:46:06.416 --> 00:46:07.708
I'm ready.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:14.500
Akid is like his father.

00:46:14.583 --> 00:46:15.875
Good,

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.458
but stubborn.

00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:20.375
And sometimes,

00:46:20.875 --> 00:46:22.541
they will try

00:46:22.625 --> 00:46:25.333
to give more than what we want

00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:27.250
even though we never asked.

00:46:30.416 --> 00:46:32.875
What do you like about Akid?

00:46:33.458 --> 00:46:35.958
I like him because

00:46:36.041 --> 00:46:38.000
he's cute.

00:46:46.333 --> 00:46:48.000
Peace be upon you, please come in.

00:46:48.083 --> 00:46:49.833
Thank you for coming.

00:46:52.875 --> 00:46:54.458
Peace be upon you, sir.

00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:55.416
Thank you for coming.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.583
Thank you, please come in.

00:46:59.666 --> 00:47:03.500
At last, the happiest
day of my life had come.

00:47:06.666 --> 00:47:08.250
It felt like

00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:16.083
time had stopped.

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:25.875
In this world,

00:47:25.958 --> 00:47:28.708
it seems like there is only me and Sarah.

00:47:31.625 --> 00:47:33.208
Akid bin Abdul Aziz,

00:47:33.291 --> 00:47:35.916
I marry you to Sarah Binti Zulkifli

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.791
with the dowry of RM250 cash.

00:47:39.375 --> 00:47:40.416
Mr Akid.,

00:47:41.666 --> 00:47:43.166
I accept the marriage

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:45.000
to Sarah Binti Zulkifli

00:47:45.083 --> 00:47:48.500
with the dowry of RM250 cash.

00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:58.250
Sometimes, don't you feel it's strange

00:47:59.041 --> 00:48:00.333
how people can be?

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.791
Because I believe

00:48:07.125 --> 00:48:10.083
everyone has experienced this.

00:48:14.333 --> 00:48:19.208
You wake up, sleep, eat, drink, work,

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:24.291
but you feel empty.

00:48:25.833 --> 00:48:27.583
What do you mean by empty?

00:48:30.125 --> 00:48:31.541
Like life has no value.

00:48:36.208 --> 00:48:38.041
Because when I work every day

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.791
that empty feeling

00:48:44.875 --> 00:48:46.458
will haunt me,

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.041
and I'm sure that

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:56.500
everyone must have
experienced that feeling too.

00:48:58.958 --> 00:49:00.125
But Sarah…

00:49:04.583 --> 00:49:07.000
Sarah made all the ordinary things

00:49:07.083 --> 00:49:09.333
feel even more worthwhile.

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:18.458
Because no matter what,

00:49:22.208 --> 00:49:25.958
I still had to go on being a cop.

00:49:39.958 --> 00:49:43.833
Sarah was also busy with her students.

00:49:48.208 --> 00:49:51.416
But we would never forget

00:49:52.916 --> 00:49:56.083
to spend time together.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.333
Even simple things like watching TV,

00:50:17.833 --> 00:50:19.708
and chatting together.

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.166
We always had things to talk about.

00:50:38.333 --> 00:50:43.791
Ordinary things like dining together.

00:50:45.958 --> 00:50:47.666
Before I knew it,

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:50.458
after Sarah came into my life,

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:56.333
I had no interest in going back.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.750
I promised myself

00:51:02.333 --> 00:51:05.083
not to use this ability anymore.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.041
I just wanted to make sure

00:51:11.125 --> 00:51:14.500
that I appreciated
every moment with Sarah.

00:51:43.458 --> 00:51:44.916
Until

00:51:48.208 --> 00:51:50.833
I made the biggest mistake

00:51:51.666 --> 00:51:53.458
of my life.

00:51:56.458 --> 00:51:57.458
Akid.

00:51:57.541 --> 00:51:58.916
Sorry for intruding on your leave.

00:51:59.708 --> 00:52:00.708
How's Sarah?

00:52:03.916 --> 00:52:05.125
No ID

00:52:05.208 --> 00:52:07.125
I think he's a first-timer.

00:52:07.208 --> 00:52:09.333
But he's had the hostages for six hours.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:12.708
We've tried talking to him, Akid.

00:52:12.791 --> 00:52:13.958
But he refused.

00:52:22.125 --> 00:52:23.250
Sir,

00:52:23.333 --> 00:52:24.791
I'm a police officer.

00:52:24.875 --> 00:52:26.125
I'm coming in.

00:52:30.708 --> 00:52:31.708
Sir.

00:52:32.291 --> 00:52:33.625
I'm a cop, I'm unarmed.

00:52:34.208 --> 00:52:35.375
I'm coming in, sir.

00:52:35.458 --> 00:52:36.333
What are you doing?

00:52:36.416 --> 00:52:37.791
-No, I'm coming in.
-Get out!

00:52:37.875 --> 00:52:38.750
No, please calm down, sir.

00:52:38.833 --> 00:52:40.500
I said, get out!

00:52:40.583 --> 00:52:41.625
Sir.

00:52:41.708 --> 00:52:45.041
I'm not armed. I'm alone, sir

00:52:45.125 --> 00:52:46.166
I said, get out!

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:48.083
-Sir.
-Get out!

00:52:48.166 --> 00:52:50.791
Sir, calm down.

00:52:50.875 --> 00:52:51.875
My name is Akid.

00:52:51.958 --> 00:52:54.791
I'm a cop. I won't do anything to you.

00:52:54.875 --> 00:52:56.541
I just want to speak to you.

00:52:56.625 --> 00:52:58.541
I don't care who you are.

00:52:58.625 --> 00:53:01.750
I said, out. Get out!

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:03.541
Calm down, sir.

00:53:03.625 --> 00:53:04.750
Calm down.

00:53:10.583 --> 00:53:12.416
Sorry ma'am, we can't wait anymore.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.875
We have to go in now.

00:53:17.083 --> 00:53:18.208
Sir, calm down.

00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:19.375
Just focus on me.

00:53:19.458 --> 00:53:21.416
I know you have problems now.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:24.625
I know you don't really want to do this.

00:53:24.708 --> 00:53:25.666
You don't get it.

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:26.958
You have children?

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:28.666
Not yet.

00:53:30.375 --> 00:53:33.250
You won't understand what it feels like

00:53:33.333 --> 00:53:36.666
to hear your child beg and cry.

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:39.291
Why? Because he's hungry

00:53:39.375 --> 00:53:41.958
and I was fired,

00:53:42.041 --> 00:53:44.625
and now they want me out of my house.

00:53:50.708 --> 00:53:52.458
Sarah, relax. Exhale.

00:53:52.541 --> 00:53:54.416
I'm not smart.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.875
I'm not successful.

00:54:00.625 --> 00:54:04.541
My wife died giving birth to my son.

00:54:07.041 --> 00:54:09.250
Doctor, the baby's heartbeat
has dropped significantly.

00:54:09.333 --> 00:54:10.625
Do we need to proceed
with a cesarean section?

00:54:10.708 --> 00:54:12.750
It's okay, let's try again.

00:54:18.625 --> 00:54:21.250
I raised my child.

00:54:21.333 --> 00:54:23.541
I raised him alone.

00:54:24.208 --> 00:54:27.625
And now they want to take him away.

00:54:27.708 --> 00:54:28.958
-They?
-Yes!

00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:31.458
You people!

00:54:31.541 --> 00:54:34.875
Who say I cannot afford to raise my child.

00:54:34.958 --> 00:54:37.541
All this while, I've lived for him.

00:54:37.625 --> 00:54:39.416
I do all this for him.

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.958
I do it all for him.

00:54:41.583 --> 00:54:43.500
I've been evicted from my house.

00:54:43.583 --> 00:54:45.541
How am I going to pay rent?

00:54:46.083 --> 00:54:47.583
Do you think I do all this just for fun?

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.125
Sarah, wake up.

00:54:52.208 --> 00:54:53.875
Push harder, I can see the head now, come.

00:54:53.958 --> 00:54:54.833
A bit more.

00:55:00.208 --> 00:55:01.541
Sarah!

00:55:01.625 --> 00:55:03.250
Sarah is in a critical condition.

00:55:13.916 --> 00:55:15.583
Sir, it's like this.

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:17.708
Hold on.

00:55:24.625 --> 00:55:25.666
I know.

00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:28.500
It's not a lot,

00:55:29.666 --> 00:55:33.541
but maybe it can help you with the rent.

00:55:34.291 --> 00:55:36.416
My wife is at the hospital

00:55:37.208 --> 00:55:38.958
giving birth to our first child.

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:42.291
I don't know what you're fighting for,

00:55:43.333 --> 00:55:45.791
but maybe in time I will know.

00:55:46.791 --> 00:55:48.166
This is what I can help you with.

00:55:54.291 --> 00:55:57.750
BAN SOON TRADING COMPANY AND DRUG STORE

00:55:58.666 --> 00:56:00.583
-Check on the hostage.
-Akid, what's going on?

00:56:00.666 --> 00:56:03.208
-He ran but the hostage is safe.
-I'm out of time.

00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:05.958
The hostage is safe, but you're running.

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:13.250
Sarah Zulkifli's ward.

00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:14.583
Hold on.

00:56:15.416 --> 00:56:17.083
-Jati Ward.
-Jati Ward, thank you.

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:43.416
Darling.

00:56:45.958 --> 00:56:48.541
It's okay, I understand.

00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:52.791
How is it? Is your work settled?

00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:57.916
Look at you.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
You don't have to worry.

00:57:01.083 --> 00:57:02.708
And you, are you okay?

00:57:04.958 --> 00:57:06.916
I'm a fighter, remember?

00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:39.500
In the name of God,
Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

00:57:39.583 --> 00:57:42.833
Peace be upon you.

00:57:42.916 --> 00:57:45.041
You want to meet Mommy?

00:57:45.125 --> 00:57:46.250
Want to meet Mommy?

00:57:47.208 --> 00:57:49.416
He's opening his eyes, dear.

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.583
-Look.
-Hi.

00:57:52.916 --> 00:57:54.875
He's yawning.

00:57:56.583 --> 00:57:58.958
Peace be upon you.

00:58:01.208 --> 00:58:02.375
Congratulations, ma'am, sir.

00:58:02.458 --> 00:58:04.083
-Thank you.
-Sorry to bother you.

00:58:04.166 --> 00:58:05.000
What is it, Doctor?

00:58:05.083 --> 00:58:08.291
Okay, I want to ask
about your family's medical history.

00:58:08.375 --> 00:58:11.875
Anyone with hemophilia?

00:58:11.958 --> 00:58:13.791
A condition in which blood clots slowly.

00:58:17.916 --> 00:58:19.250
My grandmother.

00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:25.041
Fate is not unkind.

00:58:26.541 --> 00:58:29.541
We just never know its blessings.

00:58:30.541 --> 00:58:31.375
Sarah.

00:58:32.958 --> 00:58:34.458
Don't worry.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.833
I'm confident everything will be okay.

00:58:38.083 --> 00:58:39.958
I will be with you.

00:58:40.041 --> 00:58:41.958
I will be with Anas.

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:54.666
This made me remember.

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:03.875
Dad.

00:59:03.958 --> 00:59:05.083
Dad.

00:59:06.291 --> 00:59:08.375
What are you looking at?

00:59:08.458 --> 00:59:11.041
Let's go home,
Tauke Wong is about to close.

00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:14.958
When I look at the neem tree, I remember

00:59:15.041 --> 00:59:17.208
when you had measles.

00:59:17.916 --> 00:59:19.541
I had measles?

00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:20.666
You don't even remember.

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:21.958
Remember this.

00:59:22.708 --> 00:59:25.166
When you're married with children,

00:59:26.583 --> 00:59:30.958
responsibility is not
just for worldly matters.

00:59:32.166 --> 00:59:33.916
You have to give everything.

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:37.375
You live for your children, remember that.

00:59:41.875 --> 00:59:45.250
Maybe because, deep down, I knew

00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:47.041
I was afraid that

00:59:48.875 --> 00:59:53.333
I couldn't be a good dad like my dad.

00:59:54.375 --> 00:59:55.833
But

00:59:58.291 --> 01:00:02.291
I could still try my best.

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.666
The most important thing

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.875
was to be happy.

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:32.000
But in a flash,

01:00:33.375 --> 01:00:37.083
time passes when we're happy.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.375
You.

01:00:41.458 --> 01:00:43.041
Talk to him.

01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:45.791
Nas.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:48.208
How many times have I told you
not to drink sweet drinks?

01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:50.000
This is only a little.

01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:52.666
No, it's not a little, it's a lot.

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:53.750
Look.

01:00:54.625 --> 01:00:57.166
I told you not to fold your sleeves.

01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:59.208
Enough.

01:00:59.291 --> 01:01:01.416
-He's annoyed at us?
-Let's go.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.125
-Let's go.
-Dad, do you know what day it is today?

01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:07.083
Of course I know.

01:01:07.166 --> 01:01:08.958
I wouldn't forget.

01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:10.125
Let's go.

01:01:27.875 --> 01:01:29.083
Quickly, make a wish.

01:01:29.875 --> 01:01:33.458
I wish that Mom wouldn't nag me anymore.

01:01:34.541 --> 01:01:35.916
It's not nice to make a wish like that.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.125
-Wish properly.
-Okay.

01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:41.208
I wish that you and Dad will always

01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:44.166
be around for my birthdays until I'm old.

01:01:44.916 --> 01:01:47.708
Get real, just say you want an iPad.

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:49.375
I want that too.

01:01:58.291 --> 01:01:59.500
Have we

01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:02.000
ever felt sad

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:05.250
when we are happy

01:02:09.416 --> 01:02:11.083
because we're afraid

01:02:14.291 --> 01:02:16.833
we will be sad

01:02:22.208 --> 01:02:24.041
when that happiness is gone?

01:02:31.166 --> 01:02:33.833
Because after that

01:02:35.916 --> 01:02:37.916
my life was destroyed.

01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:00.291
-It's raining. Still want to go out?
-Yes.

01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:01.833
This kid.

01:03:09.333 --> 01:03:10.583
Huh?

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:11.958
What's wrong, Mom?

01:03:12.875 --> 01:03:13.708
I don't know.

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:18.375
NATIONAL POLICE STATION

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:36.666
Your dad never picks up the phone.

01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:42.416
-Want to take a FlyCar?
-Yes.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.375
Okay, take off your seatbelt.

01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:45.750
Wait for me, don't go out first.

01:03:46.833 --> 01:03:47.916
Anas.

01:03:49.666 --> 01:03:50.708
Okay, get in.

01:03:50.791 --> 01:03:51.791
Be careful.

01:03:58.416 --> 01:03:59.708
Anas.

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:02.875
I told you not to fold your sleeves.

01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:06.208
I don't want you
to fall and hurt yourself.

01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:16.916
Come, Anas.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.250
Thank you, sir.

01:04:25.708 --> 01:04:26.708
Wait, Anas.

01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:31.041
Not too fast, you'll get soaked.

01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:35.166
Home would be so good right now.

01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:49.583
Okay, let's go.

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:03.916
Anas.

01:06:07.458 --> 01:06:09.541
At the time, I realized

01:06:10.083 --> 01:06:11.625
a strange thing.

01:06:16.625 --> 01:06:19.125
I wasn't haunted by sadness.

01:06:24.291 --> 01:06:25.666
I was just

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:27.666
angry

01:06:30.958 --> 01:06:32.500
because I knew

01:06:33.166 --> 01:06:35.250
I could change this.

01:06:35.916 --> 01:06:37.791
In this world,

01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:39.458
only I was able to.

01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:47.541
You.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.083
Now I've been kicked out of the house!

01:07:07.625 --> 01:07:09.625
After all that I've done.

01:07:09.708 --> 01:07:12.250
This is how you repay me?

01:07:13.541 --> 01:07:16.250
I regret helping you.

01:07:18.625 --> 01:07:20.958
What time? Where?

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:25.250
I am asking you, what time? Where?

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:28.000
What time did you kill my wife and child?

01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:30.250
What time? What time?

01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:49.208
This time, I won't make

01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:52.833
the same mistake.

01:07:55.166 --> 01:07:56.416
This time I know

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.291
I can go back.

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.208
Because in this world,

01:08:01.291 --> 01:08:03.166
only I can beat time.

01:08:32.583 --> 01:08:34.125
Where are you going?

01:08:46.166 --> 01:08:47.583
I'm going to buy Lego.

01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:50.083
Lego? We just bought Lego last week.

01:08:50.166 --> 01:08:51.666
I want more.

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:55.333
Okay, we'll ask Dad to buy some. Okay?

01:09:03.041 --> 01:09:04.541
Sarah.

01:09:04.625 --> 01:09:05.625
Sarah.

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:07.166
Anas, don't cross the road.

01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:08.291
Sarah.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.333
Sarah!

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:51.916
NATIONAL POLICE DEPARTMENT
PEACEFUL, FAIR, EFFICIENT

01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:01.083
Where are you going?

01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:22.458
Sarah.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.791
This flower is destined to wither.

01:11:34.875 --> 01:11:38.791
Whatever you do, it will still wither.

01:11:38.875 --> 01:11:40.791
Sometimes, Akid,

01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:45.000
you have to accept things
that are destined to happen.

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:58.750
Akid.

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:01.083
Try to make me understand.

01:12:01.166 --> 01:12:05.625
Why don’t you go back
to one or two days earlier?

01:12:10.666 --> 01:12:14.125
-You studied what I told you to yesterday?
-Yes.

01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:15.291
All of it?

01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:18.125
Okay, you're going to get an A?

01:12:21.125 --> 01:12:22.166
All right.

01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:26.375
Sarah.

01:12:26.458 --> 01:12:28.250
You don't have to send Anas today.

01:12:28.333 --> 01:12:29.916
Anas, no need to go to school, okay?

01:12:30.916 --> 01:12:32.083
Why?

01:12:32.166 --> 01:12:34.916
No, today nobody goes out.

01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:38.125
He has an exam today.

01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:39.833
Let's go, Anas.

01:12:39.916 --> 01:12:41.500
Later you help to clean up, okay?

01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:48.458
Sarah, wait. Anas.

01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:49.375
Please.

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:53.833
Don’t go out of the house today, please.

01:12:56.208 --> 01:12:58.208
Why are you acting so strange today?

01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:03.333
Wait here, I'm going to the toilet.

01:13:03.416 --> 01:13:04.541
Wait a moment.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.458
Anas, darling.

01:13:08.541 --> 01:13:09.458
You go inside.

01:13:09.541 --> 01:13:11.250
Go play, do whatever you want.

01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:12.250
School is canceled today.

01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:28.791
Sarah.

01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:33.583
No, no.

01:13:33.666 --> 01:13:35.250
Don't, Sarah.

01:13:35.333 --> 01:13:36.791
Sarah, no.

01:13:40.208 --> 01:13:41.375
No.

01:13:42.833 --> 01:13:43.875
Anas.

01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:45.666
Darling.

01:13:46.708 --> 01:13:47.791
Anas.

01:13:57.125 --> 01:13:59.333
Your exam is tomorrow, right?

01:13:59.875 --> 01:14:01.458
I've circled it in your book.

01:14:01.541 --> 01:14:03.833
-You just have to read it.
-Okay.

01:14:03.916 --> 01:14:07.333
Promise to be a good boy and get all As.

01:14:10.958 --> 01:14:12.625
Don't you want your cake?

01:14:19.375 --> 01:14:20.791
Do you want anything to eat?

01:14:20.875 --> 01:14:22.416
Noodles? I'll make it for you.

01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:29.333
Mom, I want nuggets.

01:14:29.416 --> 01:14:31.458
No, there's fried chicken there.

01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:33.541
-Mom, I want nuggets.
-No.

01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:35.833
There's fried chicken, there's cake.
Why do you want nuggets?

01:14:35.916 --> 01:14:37.000
I want nuggets!

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:39.333
No, Anas. I said no.

01:14:39.416 --> 01:14:40.541
But I want nuggets!

01:14:40.625 --> 01:14:41.708
Anas don't play with that gas.

01:14:41.791 --> 01:14:43.458
It's dangerous.

01:14:43.541 --> 01:14:44.666
I want nuggets.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:46.666
Don't play with the gas.

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:48.791
It's dangerous.

01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:52.041
Anas, don't touch it. It's dangerous.

01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:14.416
Anas.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.625
Anas, are you okay?

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:17.625
Anything?

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.500
Anas.

01:15:24.916 --> 01:15:25.916
Anas.

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:28.750
Anas.

01:15:28.833 --> 01:15:31.083
Anas.

01:15:31.791 --> 01:15:33.125
-Anas!
-Sir!

01:15:33.208 --> 01:15:35.708
-Sarah, what happened?
-Baby! I don't know!

01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:37.083
-I don't know!
-Anas!

01:15:37.791 --> 01:15:38.708
What's this?

01:15:38.791 --> 01:15:40.208
That's enough!

01:15:41.208 --> 01:15:43.041
Sir? Sir!

01:15:43.125 --> 01:15:44.791
-Sir, please open the door.
-Oh, God!

01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:46.000
Sarah.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.875
-I tried.
-Where are my car keys?

01:15:48.958 --> 01:15:50.166
The keys…

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:52.250
Whatever I could,

01:15:54.333 --> 01:15:55.333
I tried,

01:15:55.416 --> 01:15:56.458
Why, sir?

01:15:57.375 --> 01:15:58.416
-Sir?
-Anas!

01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:59.666
and tried,

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.250
and tried.

01:16:08.083 --> 01:16:09.541
The more I tried,

01:16:11.708 --> 01:16:13.541
the less logical it became.

01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:18.375
But I kept on trying.

01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:25.666
But after a while,

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:28.583
I understood.

01:16:32.791 --> 01:16:34.458
The more I went back,

01:16:36.166 --> 01:16:41.125
the worse their deaths became.

01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:50.416
Why didn't you stop Hisham

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.083
from driving that day? Maybe you could--

01:16:52.166 --> 01:16:54.791
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:57.250
I have tried everything.

01:17:00.541 --> 01:17:01.625
I…

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.333
I have tried everything.

01:17:17.958 --> 01:17:19.666
When I go back,

01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:23.958
I have to go through it

01:17:26.083 --> 01:17:27.958
all over again,

01:17:29.833 --> 01:17:33.166
and I cannot change anything.

01:17:35.208 --> 01:17:36.416
Why?

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:40.333
Because I realized I could only

01:17:40.416 --> 01:17:45.041
save them at that exact moment.

01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:49.000
Only at the moment of the accident.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.458
Where are you going?

01:18:04.416 --> 01:18:05.333
Akid.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.500
Aren't you tired?

01:18:19.375 --> 01:18:20.875
When you are determined

01:18:21.833 --> 01:18:23.458
to fight fate,

01:18:35.083 --> 01:18:37.208
you cease to be human.

01:18:43.166 --> 01:18:45.666
At that time I became obsessed.

01:20:21.708 --> 01:20:23.625
I couldn't give up.

01:20:35.416 --> 01:20:36.458
Akid.

01:20:36.958 --> 01:20:38.000
What is this?

01:20:39.958 --> 01:20:42.375
TUN ISMAIL TOWER

01:20:42.458 --> 01:20:44.458
Whatever happened,

01:20:45.666 --> 01:20:47.208
I would win.

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:20.708
SEVEN HOURS AND FIFTY-FOUR MINUTES
EIGHT HOURS

01:21:29.291 --> 01:21:30.416
Where are you going?

01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:36.958
Akid.

01:21:37.583 --> 01:21:38.541
What are you doing?

01:21:39.666 --> 01:21:43.125
After hundreds of attempts,

01:21:43.208 --> 01:21:44.166
Akid.

01:21:46.458 --> 01:21:49.291
hundreds of failures.

01:22:10.208 --> 01:22:12.000
But I've researched,

01:22:12.083 --> 01:22:14.333
I've memorized, I've repeated.

01:22:15.041 --> 01:22:16.375
Hundreds of times.

01:22:16.875 --> 01:22:18.833
Hundreds of times.

01:22:48.416 --> 01:22:51.166
Hey! That's my motorcyle!

01:23:06.333 --> 01:23:08.708
Nineteenth Street, Kerinchi.

01:23:08.791 --> 01:23:09.958
Hurry.

01:23:18.916 --> 01:23:20.500
Those hundreds of attempts

01:23:20.583 --> 01:23:22.166
in about…

01:23:26.166 --> 01:23:27.916
more than a year.

01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:36.666
But in the end,

01:23:38.416 --> 01:23:40.208
I had the answer

01:23:41.541 --> 01:23:43.000
to my struggle.

01:23:47.166 --> 01:23:48.708
After the traffic light, just stop.

01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:50.041
After the traffic light, stop.

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:51.375
Stop.

01:23:59.375 --> 01:24:02.416
I can only pick one.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.750
Sarah!

01:24:55.916 --> 01:24:59.791
Even though I was able to save Sarah,

01:25:04.208 --> 01:25:06.666
the Sarah I saved

01:25:08.416 --> 01:25:10.458
wasn't the same Sarah.

01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:16.208
Why didn't you save Anas?

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:25.291
Honestly, I was afraid

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:31.500
that if I tried another time,

01:25:32.250 --> 01:25:35.333
I would lose Sarah again.

01:26:05.958 --> 01:26:09.708
Why didn't you save Anas?

01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:27.791
Why didn't you go back?

01:27:36.583 --> 01:27:40.208
Why didn't you go back and save Anas?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.708
I told you.

01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:58.291
I won't go back.

01:28:46.583 --> 01:28:48.333
Why are you lying?

01:29:17.791 --> 01:29:19.416
Hundreds of times, Sarah.

01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:29.291
I went back hundreds of times.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.666
Maybe if I go back again,

01:29:39.333 --> 01:29:41.958
-you wouldn't be here.
-You shouldn't have saved me!

01:29:58.541 --> 01:30:00.250
You remember this?

01:30:02.708 --> 01:30:04.291
What's this, Datin?

01:30:04.375 --> 01:30:07.458
Sarah, since my son joined your class

01:30:07.541 --> 01:30:09.791
his social anxiety has lessened.

01:30:09.875 --> 01:30:11.250
But, unfortunately,

01:30:11.333 --> 01:30:13.833
my husband is transferring to Sabah.

01:30:15.625 --> 01:30:17.291
My husband and I noticed.

01:30:17.375 --> 01:30:20.000
Aikido has helped my son immensely.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.291
Please coach my son in Sabah.

01:30:27.791 --> 01:30:30.250
I need a little more time.

01:30:32.875 --> 01:30:36.375
I have personal reasons, Datin.

01:30:41.416 --> 01:30:42.250
Yes, Datin.

01:30:50.833 --> 01:30:52.500
What's your point, exactly?

01:30:56.208 --> 01:30:57.666
I should have

01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:03.375
accepted the offer to go to Sabah.

01:31:06.625 --> 01:31:08.166
If I had accepted it,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.791
I wouldn't be hurt like this.

01:31:24.958 --> 01:31:26.041
Akid!

01:31:29.833 --> 01:31:31.750
You have to go back.

01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:36.458
Whatever happens.

01:31:36.541 --> 01:31:39.708
You have to go back!

01:31:40.333 --> 01:31:41.458
You hear me?

01:31:42.708 --> 01:31:44.416
You have to go back!

01:31:46.291 --> 01:31:47.541
You hear me?

01:31:47.625 --> 01:31:49.291
You have to go back!

01:31:50.583 --> 01:31:52.791
You have to go back, Akid!

01:31:52.875 --> 01:31:54.125
Akid!

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:56.250
You have to go back!

01:31:56.333 --> 01:31:58.500
You have to go back!

01:31:59.625 --> 01:32:03.666
I don't want to be afraid of my future.

01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:06.625
And I don't want to regret the past.

01:32:07.791 --> 01:32:10.125
I want to live for the moment.

01:32:11.625 --> 01:32:14.083
Akid, go back!

01:32:14.166 --> 01:32:17.083
Go back! You have to go back!

01:32:17.166 --> 01:32:18.375
Akid!

01:32:18.916 --> 01:32:21.875
You have to go back, understand?

01:32:21.958 --> 01:32:23.041
Understand?

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:36.250
I managed to save Anas,

01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:38.583
but…

01:33:38.666 --> 01:33:40.541
Dad, where's Mom?

01:33:40.625 --> 01:33:43.958
Dad, where's Mom? I want Mom.

01:33:44.041 --> 01:33:47.250
Dad, where's Mom? I want Mom.

01:33:47.333 --> 01:33:50.791
Dad, where's Mom? I want Mom.

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:53.291
Dad, I want Mom.

01:33:53.375 --> 01:33:54.458
Look at this.

01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:57.166
This is Mom, right? Look at this.

01:33:57.250 --> 01:33:58.958
Look at all of this.

01:33:59.041 --> 01:34:00.166
Look at it, Anas. Look.

01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:01.291
Look at all of this.

01:34:01.375 --> 01:34:02.708
Look as much as you want!

01:34:04.708 --> 01:34:06.083
Mom is gone!

01:34:06.583 --> 01:34:07.875
Mom is no longer with us.

01:34:07.958 --> 01:34:10.041
Mom won't be back.

01:34:10.875 --> 01:34:12.791
Listen here.
I'm going to say it one more time!

01:34:12.875 --> 01:34:14.791
Where's Mom? Where's Mom?
I don't want to hear it anymore!

01:34:14.875 --> 01:34:16.125
You understand?

01:34:16.208 --> 01:34:17.333
I don't want to hear anymore!

01:34:17.416 --> 01:34:18.833
Enough! Enough!

01:34:19.958 --> 01:34:20.958
Anas.

01:34:22.125 --> 01:34:23.375
Anas.

01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:24.500
Anas.

01:34:49.375 --> 01:34:52.958
After that, my relationship
with Anas fell apart.

01:34:54.166 --> 01:34:56.416
Without Sarah, I didn't know…

01:34:56.958 --> 01:34:57.958
Eat your medicine first.

01:34:59.458 --> 01:35:02.416
how to be a good dad.

01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:04.916
Finish your medicine first.

01:35:16.791 --> 01:35:17.958
Without Sarah,

01:35:18.958 --> 01:35:20.291
I became a failure.

01:35:25.291 --> 01:35:28.958
The same thing happened
after I saved Sarah.

01:35:37.708 --> 01:35:39.000
Anas

01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:42.083
was not the same.

01:35:43.125 --> 01:35:45.000
He was a stranger.

01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:49.958
But this time,
everything was caused by me.

01:35:58.208 --> 01:35:59.833
Sometimes,

01:35:59.916 --> 01:36:01.250
I feel

01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:06.375
the ability that I have

01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:09.750
is not a gift.

01:36:14.291 --> 01:36:15.750
It's more like a curse.

01:36:25.875 --> 01:36:27.125
So,

01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:30.791
after that…

01:36:54.125 --> 01:36:55.833
-Akid.
-Mom.

01:36:57.416 --> 01:36:59.208
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

01:37:00.083 --> 01:37:01.666
Grandma.

01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:03.291
Anas.

01:37:06.666 --> 01:37:09.125
I thought I'd take Anas out today.

01:37:09.875 --> 01:37:11.875
Just to hang out.

01:37:11.958 --> 01:37:14.500
Why didn't you ask me first, Mom?

01:37:14.583 --> 01:37:16.333
It might be risky.

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:20.000
Go and get ready.

01:37:24.791 --> 01:37:26.583
What's wrong with you?

01:37:26.666 --> 01:37:28.000
Why?

01:37:28.083 --> 01:37:30.125
You know that Anas has hemophilia.

01:37:30.208 --> 01:37:31.875
What if something happens?

01:37:31.958 --> 01:37:32.875
What then?

01:37:33.916 --> 01:37:36.875
You want to lock him up forever?

01:37:36.958 --> 01:37:39.291
You can't do this to your son.

01:37:40.416 --> 01:37:42.000
It's a form of abuse.

01:37:46.583 --> 01:37:47.791
Akid.

01:37:49.166 --> 01:37:51.791
What happened is not your fault.

01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:55.708
We can't control everything.

01:37:56.666 --> 01:38:00.958
Don't turn Anas into a victim.

01:38:02.916 --> 01:38:03.958
Grandma.

01:38:04.041 --> 01:38:06.208
Let's go, we're late.

01:38:06.291 --> 01:38:07.916
Yes, let's go.

01:38:15.666 --> 01:38:16.625
Akid,

01:38:18.791 --> 01:38:20.333
the past is gone.

01:38:22.125 --> 01:38:23.500
Let go of it.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.083
Sir, ma'am.

01:40:15.208 --> 01:40:18.041
We are trying to stabilize your son.

01:40:18.125 --> 01:40:19.875
He has lost a lot of blood.

01:40:19.958 --> 01:40:22.875
His blood type is O negative.

01:40:22.958 --> 01:40:26.000
We're waiting for the blood supply to come

01:40:26.083 --> 01:40:27.458
to do a transfusion.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.458
Don't Akid.

01:41:27.541 --> 01:41:31.416
Flowers will wither, Akid.

01:41:34.958 --> 01:41:36.666
You still remember?

01:41:42.041 --> 01:41:43.208
You know?

01:41:48.083 --> 01:41:49.833
You and your dad

01:41:51.958 --> 01:41:52.875
are the same,

01:41:54.166 --> 01:41:55.208
stubborn.

01:41:57.458 --> 01:41:59.166
I have told him

01:42:00.916 --> 01:42:01.958
not to.

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:07.041
Things like this shouldn't happen.

01:42:08.916 --> 01:42:10.541
He told me.

01:42:32.416 --> 01:42:34.000
Feels like an Eid morning.

01:42:38.083 --> 01:42:39.291
Help!

01:42:40.833 --> 01:42:41.958
Hey!

01:42:49.541 --> 01:42:50.708
Akid.

01:42:51.875 --> 01:42:53.333
Akid.

01:42:53.416 --> 01:42:54.375
Akid.

01:42:55.333 --> 01:42:56.416
Akid.

01:43:03.583 --> 01:43:04.500
Dad.

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:06.708
Dad, what's wrong?

01:43:07.666 --> 01:43:09.208
Let's go, we've a lot to cover.

01:43:09.291 --> 01:43:11.000
We're canceling the shopping trip.

01:43:12.583 --> 01:43:13.791
Let's just have a meal.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.208
Okay, we can.

01:43:17.333 --> 01:43:18.333
Let's go.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:19.958
Let's go.

01:43:36.416 --> 01:43:39.083
But the more he went back…

01:43:41.875 --> 01:43:44.458
The worse my death became, right?

01:43:50.166 --> 01:43:51.666
He tried

01:43:55.375 --> 01:43:56.791
so many times.

01:43:56.875 --> 01:43:58.833
Multiple times.

01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:02.583
Hundreds of times.

01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:11.791
Until

01:44:13.916 --> 01:44:15.708
he had

01:44:15.791 --> 01:44:18.000
to sacrifice himself

01:44:22.083 --> 01:44:23.625
to make sure that

01:44:24.250 --> 01:44:25.666
you were okay.

01:46:20.375 --> 01:46:22.375
Thank you for coming.

01:46:25.833 --> 01:46:27.250
I'm sorry for

01:46:28.083 --> 01:46:29.916
taking your time today.

01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:38.708
This is my son,

01:46:38.791 --> 01:46:39.875
Rahim.

01:46:41.208 --> 01:46:42.958
He just finished his SPM exams.

01:46:45.083 --> 01:46:46.208
I…

01:46:48.458 --> 01:46:50.583
I want to apologize to you.

01:46:55.833 --> 01:46:58.625
I really want to apologize to you.

01:47:03.416 --> 01:47:06.541
The money you once gave me

01:47:07.208 --> 01:47:08.875
changed my life.

01:47:10.541 --> 01:47:13.291
That money saved me.

01:47:14.208 --> 01:47:15.583
That money also

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.083
saved my child's life.

01:47:22.375 --> 01:47:23.541
But…

01:47:25.625 --> 01:47:27.458
But what I've done to you--

01:47:27.541 --> 01:47:29.208
I forgive you.

01:47:31.541 --> 01:47:32.375
What?

01:47:40.708 --> 01:47:42.125
I forgive you.

01:47:51.875 --> 01:47:53.791
Things that are meant to happen,

01:47:55.208 --> 01:47:57.000
we can't prevent.

01:48:01.041 --> 01:48:02.916
Everything has been written.

01:48:37.458 --> 01:48:38.833
Akid.

01:48:38.916 --> 01:48:41.375
I know you want to express everything,

01:48:42.166 --> 01:48:44.458
but my job here

01:48:44.541 --> 01:48:48.375
is to evaluate your mental condition after

01:48:50.416 --> 01:48:51.958
your son's death.

01:48:53.833 --> 01:48:55.375
Whatever it is,

01:48:55.458 --> 01:48:57.875
the government needs to know
whether you're stable enough

01:48:57.958 --> 01:48:59.458
to continue your job.

01:49:03.291 --> 01:49:04.833
What's your next plan?

01:49:05.708 --> 01:49:07.083
Thank you, Kabir.

01:49:08.416 --> 01:49:10.083
For listening to my story.

01:49:11.083 --> 01:49:12.583
It's enough.

01:49:13.291 --> 01:49:17.250
I know what I want to do next.

01:49:18.375 --> 01:49:20.916
Dad had to sacrifice himself

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.375
to make sure that you were okay.

01:49:24.458 --> 01:49:25.958
This is all I can help you with.

01:49:26.041 --> 01:49:27.291
I should have

01:49:27.375 --> 01:49:30.333
accepted the offer to Sabah.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.333
I'm sorry.

01:51:02.666 --> 01:51:04.041
I just want you to know

01:51:05.916 --> 01:51:06.833
that I

01:51:07.708 --> 01:51:09.750
love you very much.

01:51:18.875 --> 01:51:21.041
We always eat the same thing, right?

01:51:23.375 --> 01:51:24.708
Let's go out to eat?

01:51:27.125 --> 01:51:28.458
Really?

01:51:31.083 --> 01:51:32.083
Let's go.

01:51:52.916 --> 01:51:53.750
Have a good meal.

01:51:53.833 --> 01:51:55.500
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:51:57.666 --> 01:51:58.958
Anas, do you know?

01:51:59.541 --> 01:52:00.625
This is the place

01:52:01.416 --> 01:52:03.000
your mom and I

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:04.916
used to come to often.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.250
This was our dating place.

01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:10.041
Mom's favourite place.

01:52:12.541 --> 01:52:13.375
That table at the back.

01:52:15.625 --> 01:52:17.000
It was at that table

01:52:17.083 --> 01:52:20.500
we found out
that we were going to be your parents.

01:52:24.916 --> 01:52:27.750
The food here must be good, right?

01:52:29.875 --> 01:52:30.833
Eat.

01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:47.000
I'm sorry, Anas.

01:54:18.333 --> 01:54:19.791
to Anas.

01:54:19.875 --> 01:54:21.833
Did you forget my name?

01:54:21.916 --> 01:54:23.416
Dad.

01:54:26.541 --> 01:54:28.458
Anas, blow the candles.

01:54:46.375 --> 01:54:48.333
Anas, what did you wish for?

01:54:48.416 --> 01:54:51.708
I wanted an iPad but…

01:54:51.791 --> 01:54:53.666
But what, love?

01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:57.541
Maybe just to spend time with both of you.

01:55:01.958 --> 01:55:03.500
We'll go on a holiday.

01:55:03.583 --> 01:55:05.583
Together with Mom, together with Anas.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.125
Anas.

01:56:01.416 --> 01:56:03.291
-Wake up, Sarah.
-Sarah, I can see his head.

01:56:03.375 --> 01:56:05.125
A little more. Come, hurry.

01:56:11.041 --> 01:56:12.208
Sarah.

01:56:18.083 --> 01:56:20.000
A little more. Come, Sarah.

01:56:23.208 --> 01:56:24.166
Sarah.

01:56:27.708 --> 01:56:29.083
Okay, I can see his head, hurry.

01:58:11.458 --> 01:58:12.833
Are we happy?

01:58:29.833 --> 01:58:32.583
The happiest in the world.

01:58:36.708 --> 01:58:38.208
With Anas.

01:58:39.833 --> 01:58:40.958
Anas?

01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:44.375
Our son.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.125
Very cute.

01:59:17.416 --> 01:59:20.875
Looking sharp to meet your girlfriend?

02:00:46.166 --> 02:00:47.541
Eat a little.

02:00:49.291 --> 02:00:50.875
Are you just going to have soup?

02:01:03.083 --> 02:01:05.416
There's mutton.

02:01:08.458 --> 02:01:09.875
Akid, hurry.

02:01:11.375 --> 02:01:13.083
Akid, you take half,

02:01:13.166 --> 02:01:14.333
I take half.

02:01:17.333 --> 02:01:18.291
Akid.

02:01:19.875 --> 02:01:20.708
Hey!

02:01:20.791 --> 02:01:23.458
Queue up, there are people behind.

02:01:23.541 --> 02:01:25.500
There's a lot more.

02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:10.250
Dad.

02:03:39.333 --> 02:03:40.291
Dad.

02:03:41.333 --> 02:03:43.500
I'm sorry, Dad.

02:03:43.583 --> 02:03:44.916
I'm sorry, Dad.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.500
I know all this is wrong, Dad.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.750
But this is all I can do.

02:03:50.833 --> 02:03:52.791
I wanted to tell you,

02:03:53.625 --> 02:03:56.750
I understand now, Dad.

02:03:57.333 --> 02:04:01.083
I understand why you didn't go back.

02:04:01.791 --> 02:04:03.375
Why you

02:04:03.916 --> 02:04:06.750
made that decision.

02:04:06.833 --> 02:04:08.291
Because

02:04:08.375 --> 02:04:11.875
you wanted me to go on living.

02:04:12.375 --> 02:04:16.416
Akid.

02:04:18.875 --> 02:04:19.875
Dad.

02:04:21.375 --> 02:04:23.333
I am content, Dad.

02:04:24.375 --> 02:04:26.250
I'm content.

02:04:27.458 --> 02:04:30.000
I had a family, Dad.

02:04:31.041 --> 02:04:32.458
A wife.

02:04:33.333 --> 02:04:34.500
A son.

02:04:36.916 --> 02:04:39.750
Thank you, Dad,

02:04:39.833 --> 02:04:45.416
for giving me a chance to experience

02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:49.166
the beauty of life.

02:04:50.125 --> 02:04:51.583
I know

02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:54.208
according to fate,

02:04:56.541 --> 02:04:59.708
I should've gone first

02:05:00.708 --> 02:05:03.125
at the shopping mall.

02:05:03.208 --> 02:05:06.541
Dad, don't travel back anymore.

02:05:07.583 --> 02:05:10.916
Don't fight fate.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.666
I am already content.

02:05:27.333 --> 02:05:29.625
Oh, God.

02:05:33.291 --> 02:05:35.291
Thank you, Dad,

02:05:36.583 --> 02:05:39.458
for everything.

02:05:43.375 --> 02:05:45.125
Akid.

02:05:54.666 --> 02:05:57.375
Akid…

02:07:06.583 --> 02:07:07.666
Enough.

02:07:09.375 --> 02:07:10.583
Don't, darling.

02:07:20.333 --> 02:07:22.541
We have to accept fate.

02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:26.416
Just accept it.

02:07:56.875 --> 02:07:59.250
Tragedy at the Petaling Jaya
shopping center.

02:07:59.333 --> 02:08:03.333
Yesterday, an armed robbery
took the life of a teenager.

02:08:03.416 --> 02:08:07.666
Akid Bin Aziz, who tried to protect
a pregnant female worker.

02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:10.791
But unfortunately, the gunshot
took his life.
